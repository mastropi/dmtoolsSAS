V.1.00: 2015/07/29 (DM)
	- Macro created to make plots that test the Proportional Hazards assumption for survival models.
	The current macro signature is as follows:
	%PHTestPlots(
		data , 						*** Input dataset.
		target=, (REQUIRED) 		*** Target variable containing the time to the event of interest.
		censor=, (REQUIRED)			*** Censor variable containing the indicator of whether the observation is censored.
		varclass=, 					*** List of categorical input variables to analyze.
		varnum=, 		       		*** List of continuous input variables to analyze.
		censorValue=1,				*** Value that indicates censored cases.
		groups=3,					*** Nro. of groups to use in the categorization of continuous variables.
		method=KM,					*** Method to use for the Survival function estimation.
		alpha=0.05, 		 		*** Alpha level for confidence limits of the survival function.
		odspath=, 					*** Quoted name of the path where all generated files should be saved.
		odsfile=,					*** Quoted name of the file where the plots are saved.
		odsfiletype=html,			*** Type of the file specified in ODSFILE or output format.
		log=1);						*** Show messages in log?

V.1.01: 2015/09/20 (DM)
	- Added parameter IMAGEROOTNAME=PHTestPlot in order to create image files (e.g. PNG format) with meaningful names. The parameter refers to the root name to be used for all image file names generated by ODS graphics. The macro creates the files as <imagerootname>-<target>-<nro>-<variable>.<ext>.
	The change was motivated by the cumbersome of dealing with PDF files since they are too large and take ages to generate (e.g. 8 hours for 40 variables!).

V.1.02: 2015/10/15 (DM)
	- Renamed macro from %PHTestPlots to %PlotSurvival to make it more clear what it does and comply with plot macros starting with 'Plot'.
	- Changed the default value of IMAGEROOTNAME from PHTestPlot to PlotSurvival.
