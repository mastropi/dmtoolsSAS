V.1.00: 2015/08/03 (DM)
	- Macro created to qualify a set of variables into categorical or interval (continuous) and compute percent of missing and zeros.
	The current macro signature is as follows:
	%QualifyVars(
		data,						*** Input dataset (data options are allowed)
		var=_ALL_,					*** List of variables to qualify.
		maxnfreq=10,				*** Max. number of distinct values to list the distinct values.
		maxncat=10,					*** Max. number of distinct values to qualify variable as categorical.
		out=,						*** Output dataset (data options are allowed).
		sortby=level nvalues var,	*** Sorting criteria of the output dataset.
		log=1);						*** Show messages in log?

V.1.01: 2015/08/28 (DM)
	- Fixed a bug where an error occurred when no variable qualified for generating the list of distinct values taken.
	- Changed the assignment of the level variable so that character variables are ALWAYS assigned a "categorical" level.

V.1.02: 2015/09/29 (DM)
	- Did NOT record the changes done (not even in the git-commit-macros.txt file).

V.1.03: 2018/02/20 (DM)
	- Fixed a bug when counting the number of missing values of character variables. This was sometimes counted incorrectly because the NMISS() function that was used only works for NUMERIC variables. The bug was fixed by replacing the NMISS() function with a CASE WHEN missing().
