%Categorize Versions
--------------------
Created: 16-Feb-2016


V.1.00: 2016/02/16 (DM)
	- Initial version created from scratch which uses the PROC RANK to compute the groups instead of PROC UNIVARIATE as was the case in the latest version of %Categorize. That version is now stored in macro %CategorizePercentiles.
	- The goal of writing it from scracth is to "cortar por lo sano" and avoid the monster that the macro was becoming grow further, especially after adding the BY group processing.

V.1.02: 2018/01/10 (DM)
	- Changed the way the rank variables are analyzed to get the representative statistic to use for each category or bin. The following changes were made:
		- In the call to the %Means macro, the rank variable was moved from the BY= parameter to the CLASS= parameter in order to avoid an SORT by the rank variable. (this was possible thanks to the new parameter CLASS in the %Means macro!)
		- The merge between the computed statistics for each rank value and the original analyzed numeric variable is now done using indices (in order to avoid additional sorts which are time consuming!)
