%Categorize Versions
--------------------
Created: 16-Feb-2016


V.1.00: 2016/02/16 (DM)
	- Initial version created from scratch which uses the PROC RANK to compute the groups instead of PROC UNIVARIATE as was the case in the latest version of %Categorize. That version is now stored in macro %CategorizePercentiles.
	- The goal of writing it from scracth is to "cortar por lo sano" and avoid the monster that the macro was becoming grow further, especially after adding the BY group processing.
