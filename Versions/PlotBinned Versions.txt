V.1.00: 2015/08/14 (DM)
	- Macro created to make plots of a target variable in terms of binned continuous variables and in terms of categorical variables (without binning).
	The current macro signature is as follows:
	%PlotBinned(
		data , 					*** Input dataset.
		target=, (REQUIRED) 	*** Target variable to plot in the Y axis.
		var=_NUMERIC_, 		    *** List of input variables to analyze.
		varclass=, 				*** List of categorical input variables among those listed in VAR.
		datavartype=,			*** Dataset containing the type or level of the variables listed in VAR.
		groupsize=,				*** Nro. of cases each group should contain when categorizing continuous variables.
		groups=20,				*** Nro. of groups to use in the categorization of continuous variables.
		value=mean,				*** Name of the statistic for both the input and target variable in each bin.
		bubble=1,				*** Whether to generate a bubble plot instead of a scatter plot.
		xaxisorig=0,			*** Whether to use the original input variable range on the X axis.
		yaxisorig=1,			*** Whether to use the original target variable range on the Y axis.
		odspath=, 				*** Quoted name of the path where all generated files should be saved.
		odsfile=,				*** Quoted name of the file where the plots are saved.
		odsfiletype=pdf,		*** Type of the file specified in ODSFILE or output format.
		log=1);					*** Show messages in log?

V.1.02: 2015/09/02 (DM)
	- Added new parameter OUT= to generate a dataset containing the data that can be used to reproduce the plots.
	- Added new parameter OUTCORR= to generate a dataset containing the correlation between the binned values and the predicted LOESS values. The corresponding normalized correlation (by the target range in the original data) can be used as a measure of predictive power of the input variables.
	- Make use of the new macros %ExecTimeStart, %ExecTimeStop, %ODSOutputOpen, %ODSOutputClose used to measure the execution time and to open and close the ODS output files.

V.1.03: 2015/09/20 (DM)
	- Added parameter IMAGEROOTNAME=PlotBinned in order to create image files (e.g. PNG format) with meaningful names. The parameter refers to the root name to be used for all image file names generated by ODS graphics. The macro creates the files as <imagerootname>-<target>-<nro>-<variable>.<ext>.
	The change was motivated by the cumbersome of dealing with PDF files since they are too large and take ages to generate (e.g. 8 hours for 40 variables!).

V.1.04: 2015/09/28 (DM)
	- Fixed a bug with the EXCLUDE= parameter: when this was empty, an error occurred with the %Categorize macro because the case when EXCLUDE= could be empty was NOT considered!
