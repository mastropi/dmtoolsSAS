%DataComputeWithMissing Versions: Description of the different versions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Created: 12-Aug-2015


V.1.00: 2015/08/12 (DM)
	- Created the macro which generates DATA STEP statements that performs a calculation on a variable that may generate missing values on the output variable. Typically the formula that generates missing values is a ratio between two variables where the denominator can be 0.
	However, the formula can be anything and the generated statements take care of special cases when the output variable may actually be set to a value that is not missing (e.g. when the numerator is 0 and the denominator is 0, set the ratio as 0, NOT missing).
	The current macro signature is as follows:
	%DataComputeWithMissing(
		varout,						*** Variable to create as the result of FORMULA.
		var,						*** Variable that does not generate missing values in VAROUT.
		varmiss,					*** Variable that may generate missing vaues in VAROUT.
		valueout=0,					*** Value to assign to VAROUT when VAR takes the value VALUEOK.
		valueok=0,					*** Value taken by VAR that can avoids a missing value in VAROUT.
		valuemiss=0,				*** Value taken by VARMISS that generates missing values in VAROUT.
		formula=&var / &varmiss,	*** Formula to use to compute VAROUT.
		macrovar=_nmiss_ _nmissok_,	*** Name of the macro variables to store the count of missing and missing OK.
		end=lastobs);				*** Variable created in the data step that signals the last observation.
