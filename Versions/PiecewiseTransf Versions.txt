V.1.00: 2005/09/22 (DM)
	- First version whose signature is as follows:
	%PiecewiseTransf(
		data,			*** Input dataset. Data options are accepted.
		var=,			*** Blank-separated list of variables to transform.
		cuts=,			*** Either a blank-separated list of cut values or a dataset with one row per variable.
		prefix=I,		*** Prefix to use for the indicator variables of each piece.
		join=_X_,		*** Midfix to use to create the variable names for the linear part.
		fill=0,			*** Fill value or statistic to replace missing values of each analyzed variable.
		out=,			*** Output dataset containing the piecewise linear variables.
		log=1);			*** Whether to show messages in the log.

V.1.01: 2016/03/10 (DM)
	- Added new parameter INCLUDERIGHT=1 that indicates whether the right limit of each interval is included or not when defining each linear piece.
	- Removed parameter JOIN which was replaced by parameter SUFFIX, since I now implement a more reasonable naming scheme, which does not think of the piecewise variables as interaction variables between the original variable and the indicator variable created for each piece.
	- Added new parameter PREFIXDUMMY=I_ which sets the prefix to use for the dummy or indicator variables. The PREFIX=PW_ parameter is just used for the piecewise variables.
	- The variable names are now of the form:
		<prefixdummy><var><suffix><piece-nro> for the indicator variables
		<prefix><var><suffix><piece-nro> for the piecewise variables
	- Added capacity for fixing variable names and make the generated variables compliant with the 32-characters max length requested by SAS. This is done via the %FixVarNames macro which was also updated.
	- The macro signature is currently as follows:
	%PiecewiseTransf(
		data,			*** Input dataset. Data options are accepted.
		var=,			*** Blank-separated list of variables to transform when CUTS= is a list of cut values.
		cuts=,			*** Either a blank-separated list of cut values or a dataset with one row per variable.
		includeright=1,	*** Whether to include the right limit of each interval when defining each piece
		prefixdummy=I_,	*** Prefix to use for the indicator or dummy variables of each piece.
		prefix=pw_,		*** Prefix to use for the piecewise variables.
		suffix=_,		*** Suffix to use before the piece number added at the end of the new variable's name.
		fill=mean,		*** Fill value or statistic to replace missing values of each analyzed variable.
		varfix=1,		*** Whether to fix the variable names for max 32-character length compliance.
		varfixremove=,	*** One or more consecutive characters to remove from the variable name when fixing their name, if needed.
		out=,			*** Output dataset containing the indicator and piecewise linear variables. Data options are allowed.
		log=1);			*** Whether to show messages in the log.

V1.03: 2016/06/16 (DM)
	- Added new parameter DROPALLEQUAL=0, which is used to indicate whether we would like to drop the created dummy variables having all cases equal to the same value from the output dataset. It was introduced because currently this criterion is fulfilled by running a separate PROC FREQ on each variable and it takes a long time for large datasets. The next step is to call %FreqMult to compute the frequencies.
