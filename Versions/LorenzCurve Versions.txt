V.1.00: 2015/08/03 (DM)
	- Macro created to compute Lorenz curves on a non-negative target variable in terms of a set of input variables.
	The goal is to generate a number summarizing the predictive power of a variable on a non-negative continuous target variable, similar to the Gini Index for binary target. An example (motivating example) is the Time to Event used in Survival Models.
	The current macro signature is as follows:
	%LorenzCurve(
		data,					*** Input dataset.
		target=,				*** Target variable (assumed non-negative)
		var=,					*** List of input variables.
		missing=1,				*** Whether missing values in the input variables are allowed.
		out=, 					*** Output dataset containing the area between the Lorenz Curve and the diagonal
		plot=1,					*** Whether to plot the Lorenz curve of each analysis variable
		log=1)					*** Show messages in log?

V.1.01: 2015/08/29 (DM)
	- New parameters SORTBY=, ODSPATH=, ODSFILE=, and ODSFILETYPE=, the first one used to define the order of the output dataset (defaults to "descending area") and the three last ones to generate ODS output file containing the Lorenz curves.

V.1.02: 2015/09/04 (DM)
	- New parameter CONDITION= which allows the user to pass a condition that needs to be satisfied by each input variable defining cases to be included in the analysis.
	- Added the LABEL variable in the output dataset containing the input variable labels.
