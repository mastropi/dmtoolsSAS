<h1>MACRO that returns the number of observations (nobs) and variables (nvar) in a data set.</h1>
<pre>It uses the function ATTRN. Taken from Ex. 5 in %SYSFUNC help documentation.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>If the input parameter return is equal to 0, no variables are returned as a result of calling                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>the function. Otherwise, 2 variables, nobs and nvar, defined as local to this macro, are returned.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>Note: Parameters 'print' and 'log' indicate the same. The one prefered is 'log', but 'print' was left                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>for compatibility issues with previous versions.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>If return=1, then print and log are set to 0, regardless of their values.                                                                                          </pre>
