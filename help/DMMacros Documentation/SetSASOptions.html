<h1>MACRO %SetSASOptions</h1>
<pre>Sets a few of current SAS options after reading their current value, so that they can be reset by                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>%ResetSASOptions.                                                                                                       </pre>
<pre>                                                                                                                        </pre>
<pre>Note that macro variables are defined here as global macro variables. The reason for doing this is                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>to avoid having to change each macro that calls %SetSASOptions whenever a new option wants to be set.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>                                                                                                                        </pre>
<pre>Note also the use of the global macro variable &_Macro_Call_Level_. This macro variable contains the value                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>of the call level at which the macro call to %SetSASOptions is performed. For example, if macro %A calls                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>macro %B, and both macro %A and macro %B call %SetSASOptions, then &_Macro_Call_Level_ is set to 1,                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>when %SetSASOptions is called from macro %A, whereas all subsequent calls to %SetSASOptions increase                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>the value of &_Macro_Call_Level_ by 1. The options are only set at the first call to %SetSASOptions,                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>otherwise the current settings would be overriden in subsequents calls to %SetSASOptions.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>The value of &_Macro_Call_Level_ is decreased by %ResetSASOptions, whenever this macro is being called, first                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>by %B and then by %A. When %ResetSASOptions is called at the last level, macro variable _Macro_Call_Level_                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>is deleted.                                                                                                             </pre>
<pre>                                                                                                                        </pre>
<pre>%SetSASOptinos is used by different macros, for example for setting the value of the nonotes option, to                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>avoid showing SAS messages in the log.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>                                                                                                                        </pre>

<h3>HISTORY:</h3>
<pre>- 2015/09/02: Added VARLENCHK= parameter to set the VARLENCHK= option.                                                                                          </pre>
