<pre>This macro rounds a number to the closest number, where closest depends on the magnitude                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>of the absolute value, being proportional to 1/10th of its first significant value (1/10th                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>is the default and can be adjusted with parameter ROUNDOFF=. For ex. if ROUNDOFF=0.001, then                                                                                          </pre>

<pre>number upwards would be 0.38. If x = 37.4, the respective closest numbers are 37 and 38.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>                                                                                                                        </pre>
<pre>By default, a positive number is rounded upwards and a negative number is rounded downwards.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>This comes from assuming that this macro is commonly used to round the minimum and maximum                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>numbers of a plotting variable and that the number 0 is in between the minimum and the maximum.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>For ex. a plot for which the values in the vertical axis variable run from -3.231 to 2.8374.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>If the number is 0, 0 is returned.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>                                                                                                                        </pre>
<pre>The upwards and downwards default rounding can be changed with parameter ROUND=, which should                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>be equal to UP to force an upwards rounding and equal to DOWN to force a donwards rounding.                                                                                          </pre>
