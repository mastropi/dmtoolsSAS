<pre>This macro detects collinearities among continuous variables.                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>Currently the only implemented method is the one that is based on the                                                                                          </pre>

<pre>A variable is considered collinear with the other variables when its VIF is larger                                                                                          </pre>

<pre>the variables are removed one by one. The variable with the largest 'criterion' value                                                                                          </pre>

<pre>variables. The criterion of removal depends on the DATACORR parameter: if this parameter                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>is empty, the criterion is simply given by the variable's VIF; if DATACORR is not empty,                                                                                          </pre>
<pre>the criterion is given by a combination of the variable's VIF and the variable's                                                                                          </pre>

<pre>The macro is useful to detect and remove variables with redundant information prior to                                                                                          </pre>
